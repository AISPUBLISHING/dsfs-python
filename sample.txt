YOU don't know about me without you have read a book by the
name of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain't no
matter. That book was made by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told
the truth, mainly. There was things which he stretched, but
mainly he told the truth. That is nothing. never seen
anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt
Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary. Aunt Polly--Tom's Aunt
Polly, she is--and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told
about in that book, which is mostly a true book, with some
stretchers, as I said before.
